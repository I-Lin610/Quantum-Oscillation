# Quantum-Oscillation
quantum oscillation data analysis of the SdH oscillation in transport manetoresistance data:. We could extract the cyclontron frequency and effective mass of each bands through the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of oscillation signal and the temperature dependence of amplitude of the oscillation peaks. The background selection also changes the analysis results and is worth trying linear, nonlinear, Gassian function to get the consistent result. For Zeeman effect, the energy states split under magnetic field. The  oscillation phase includes Berry"s phase, oscillation frequency, phase shift from dimentionality and the g factor.

1. If the splitting energy is the same and the g factor does not change within the experimental field range, we could seperate the Zeeman effect from the oscillation phase term. It is possible to obtain Berry"s phase in this situation.

2. We could estimate the g factor by the means of the harmonic ratio, but still requires other experimental data as references.
